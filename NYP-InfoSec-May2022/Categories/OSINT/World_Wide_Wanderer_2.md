## Solution

1. Continuing from the pastebin with the flag for World Wide Wanderer 1, the description reads:
```
We need a plan to travel across Asia since it is a huge continent.
Please provide us with your wisdom and prowess to calculate how far do I need to walk in a straight line, from The Dome of the Rock to Kaaba.
Convert the distance to nearest kilometer and search for that Point number on the Asia continent.
Tip: If you can't find the correct Point, just +-1 or +-2 of the result you got until you find the correct point.
```
2. To do that, I went over to google maps and planted a point (left click) at The Dome, then I right clicked and selected measure distance.
3. I place another point at Kabba and google maps tells me the distance is about 1238km.
4. Looking for point 1238 on the map in Asia, bring us to a location in lebanon with the pastebin that leads us to the flag: https://pastebin.com/RpWB4vRv
